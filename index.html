                        Hi, I'm Matthew Kim, I’m a Sophomore at Johns Hopkins University, and coding is my passion. Yeah yeah, I know that’s stereotypical, but trust me, I love to code. This all started January of 2017. Before then, I had never coded a single day in my life, but only decided to start teach myself because I heard that Investment Banks wanted more people to know more code (I was an Econ major then). But then plot twist, turns out, I liked coding way way more than economics and anything else in school. Up until that point, I simply accepted that I was not going to enjoy learning in college, but would have to go to get a job. I’m not sure you understand how happy I was to realize that I could major in something that I loved(and will get me a job). So second semester freshman year, without any prior coding experience, I decided to switch majors from Economics to Computer Science without a second thought. So yeah, trust me, I love to code.

                     Created with Java, this simple star-catching game implements a depth-first search algorithm to construct
                     unique maze layouts and randomly selects from three possible worlds after each launch. The goal is to capture as many
                     stars as possible without colliding with the maze walls. Each collision decreases player speed, and after
                     the player's speed has dropped to a certain amount, the game is over and the score is printed onto the screen.
